          I am a rising junior at Harvard College majoring in statistics and computer science. My coursework has provided me with a strong foundation in machine learning, data structures, algorithms, probability, and statistical inference. This academic background is complemented by my involvement in tech-driven extracurriculars such as Harvard Tech for Social Good (T4SG), where I engage in impactful projects aimed at societal benefit. </p>
          
        <p className="mb-3">  In addition to my coursework, I work part-time as a research assistant for PhD candidate Emily Silcock, where I am involved in training a large language model to classify texts related to the Syrian Civil War. I am also very passionate about education. This upcoming semester will mark my second year as a course assistant for CS50, Harvardâ€™s introductory computer science course, where I support students in mastering foundational programming concepts. </p>

          This summer I am continuing my work with CS50 as a Summer Fellow in their Research & Development Team, where I am designing artificial intelligence educational tools to be used in future iterations of the course. Outside of academics, I sing Tenor 2 with the Harvard Glee Club (watch our latest concert <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/FYX1sGmoS44?si=d9iia-OWS6RQMD9N&t=4163" target="_blank" style={{ textDecoration: 'underline' }}>here</a>!), am a member of the Cuban-American Undergraduate Student Association, and enjoy traveling the world.
